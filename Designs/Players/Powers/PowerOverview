Lightning
    Most abilities build charge
    Every turn the charater loses charge
    Some abilities deal more damage the higher your charge
    If you go over the max, then you take a LOT of damage, but also deal damage around you.

    Design goals;  Make it difficult to get rid of charge so the user has to manage their skill use.

Earth

Blink
    Teleportation.  Connects two points together and moves something through them.
    Each blink attack uses some number of charges.  Charges regenerate slowly -- one per turn
    General upgrades;  Faster recharge.  More max charges.

Pain Transfer
    Support and damage based character
    Has two resources -- one gains stacks when damage is dealt, and one gains stacks when healing happens
    Stronger heals require spending damage stacks
    Stronger damage requires spending heal stacks

    Reminder about healing goals;  whenever a unit takes damage, they lose max health as well as current health.
    It should be impossible to heal forever.
