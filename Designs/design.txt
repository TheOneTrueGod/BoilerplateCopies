This is a co-op D&D style game.
Each game is a campaign that takes place over the course of several missions.
The story behind the campaign is that the world has been covered by an encroaching darkness, and only special lights can push it back.
The players are part of a caravan that has been sent into the darkness to retrieve a power source for the lights in the capital.
Each player will have 1-3 characters in the caravan, but they can only bring one along on any given mission.
Before each mission begins, the team will get to vote on which of several different missions they want to go on.  If there's a tie, a random one will be chosen.
Missions will be turn-based combat, with a 'darkness' mechanic.  Example;  Caravan moves from point A to point B on the map.  Defend it until you reach point B.
